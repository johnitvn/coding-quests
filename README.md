## How do they work / how do I get started?

The scaffolding of each challenges / app is done for you and each challenge has _create-react-app_ as its foundation.

- Clone the whole challenges repository
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` in any of the individual challenge directories to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the application on port 3000 (CRA default)
- Each challenge has a README with requirements for you to complete

_Some challenges might require usage of external APIs, but all information will be provided in the individual challenge readme._
